         The application must save calculation results to text files in the 
         "calculation trees" directory.


[SHOULD-HAVE]

FR-2.1   Interactive UI
         The application should provide an interactive textual user interface 
         (wizard) for recipe selection and configuration instead of requiring 
         manual Config.json edits.

FR-2.2   Multiple Output Formats
         The application should support both verbose and compact output formats 
         for calculation results.

FR-2.3   Console Logging
         The application should provide optional console logging output for 
         debugging purposes.

FR-2.4   Verbose Mode
         The application should support detailed step-by-step breakdown of 
         calculations in verbose mode.


[COULD-HAVE]

FR-3.1   Recipe Search
         The application could implement a search function to find recipes by 
         item name or keyword within the wizard interface.

FR-3.2   Export to HTML
         The application could support exporting calculation results to HTML 
         format for better formatting and sharing.

FR-3.3   Save User Preferences
         The application could remember users last selected product and belt 
         color for faster subsequent use.

FR-3.4   Batch Processing
         The application could process multiple items in a single execution 
         and generate reports for all.



[WILL-NOT-HAVE]

FR-4.1   Real-time Factorio Integration
         The application will not directly connect to or modify active Factorio 
         game instances.

FR-4.2   Network Multiplayer
         The application will not support multiplayer or network synchronization 
         features.

FR-4.3   Create Diagram
         The application will not support creating Diagrams of the  
         Machines and how to place them in game 


===============================================================================
NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
===============================================================================

[MUST-HAVE]

NFR-1.1  Performance
         Calculation results must be returned within 3 seconds for any valid 
         recipe request.

NFR-1.2  Data Integrity
         The application must validate JSON data files and reject malformed 
         or incomplete data with clear error messages.

NFR-1.3  Logging
         The application must maintain a log file (factorio_calculator.log) 
         with all significant operations and errors.

NFR-1.4  Error Handling
         The application must handle missing files, invalid JSON, and invalid 
         recipe names gracefully with informative error messages.

NFR-1.5  Python Version Support
         The application must run on Python 3.8 or higher.


[SHOULD-HAVE]

NFR-2.1  Code Documentation
         The application code should be well-documented with docstrings and 
         comments explaining key logic.

NFR-2.2  Modularity
         The application should be organized into logical modules with clear 
         separation of concerns (loader, calculator, UI, output).

NFR-2.3  Configuration Flexibility
         The application should support environment variables for customizing 
         file paths and logging behavior.

NFR-2.4  Usability
         The UI should be intuitive with clear instructions and reasonable 
         default values.


[COULD-HAVE]

NFR-3.1  Memory Efficiency
         The application could optimize memory usage for very large calculation 
         trees with hundreds of items.
